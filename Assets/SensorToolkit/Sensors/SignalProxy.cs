     * This could be useful for example if you have characters with Rigidbodies/Colliders on
     * each of its limbs. You could put this component on each limb and point it to the root
     * GameObject of the character. Then if a sensor detects one or more of the limbs, it will
     * show the root GameObject in the list of detections. Otherwise the limbs would each be
     * detected separately.
